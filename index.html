      I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I have to
      say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an amazing developer. He
      stresses on good, clean code and pays heed to the details. I love
      developers who respect each and every aspect of a throughly thought out
      design and do their best to put it in code. He goes over and beyond and
      transforms ART into PIXELS - without a glitch, every time.
